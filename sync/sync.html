    <h1>Sync in JS</h1>
    <h3>Synchronous</h3>
    <p>Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction
        waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.</p>
    <h3>Asynchronous</h3>
    <p>Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which
        causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and
        doesn't block the flow.</p>
