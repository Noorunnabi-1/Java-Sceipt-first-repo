    <h2>Events in JS</h2>
    <p>The change in the state of an object is known as an Event.Events are fired to notify code of "interesting
        changes" that may affect code execution.</p>
    <p>Mouse events (click, double click etc.) <br>
        Keyboard events (keypress, keyup, keydown)<br>
        Form events (submit etc.)<br>
        Print event & many more</p>
    <button onclick="console.log('button1 was clicked!');alert('Hello!')">Click me!</button>
    <button ondblclick="console.log('button2 was clicked 2x!')">Click me 2 times!</button>
    <div onmouseover="console.log('You are inside div1.')">This is a div1</div>
    <p>These are inline event handling.</p>

    <h2>Event Handling in JS</h2>
    <p><b>node.event = ( ) => {
            //handle here
            }</b>
    </p>
    <p><b>btn.onclick = ( ) => {
            console.log(“btn was clicked”);
            }</b>
    </p>
    <button id="btn3">Click me!</button>
    <div class="box">This is a div2</div>
    <p>Event handling in JavaScriptis is preferred than inline handling.If event handling in JavaScript is two times
        then preferred second handling. </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Event Objects</h2>
    <p>It is a special object that has details about the event.All event handlers have access to the Event Object's
        properties and methods.</p>
    <p><b>node.event = (e) => {
            //handle here
            } </b></p>
    <p><b>e.target, e.type, e.clientX, e.clientY</b></p>
    <button id="btn4">Click me!</button>
    <div class="box2">This is a div3</div>
    <hr>
    <h2>Event Listeners</h2>
    <p><b>node.addEventListener( event, callback )</b></p>
    <p><b>node.removeEventListener( event, callback )</b></p>
    <p><b>*Note : the callback reference should be same to remove</b></p>
    <p>In Event Listeners we can multiple work in one event.This is a benefit of Event Listeners.If you delete any btn
        further then store it in a variable and pass it at the end to the removeEventListener.</p>

    <button id="btn5">Click me!</button>
